1. [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org)

    This course requires us to make a GitHub page with markdown. Me, having no experience with markdown found this page quite useful to familiarize myself with the syntaxes and best practices in markdowns.

2. [DILLINGER](https://dillinger.io/)
    
    Online markdown editor. The initial page serves as an example of markdown.

3. [RegExr](https://regexr.com/) and [i Hate Regex](https://ihateregex.io/)

    Do you hate writing regex? i Hate Regex has a bunch of regex for common problems, such as username, email, phone numbers, dates, and more! On the other hand, RegExr has a regex cheatsheet, lets you test out regex, and even explains the regex for you!

7. [The Art of Command Line](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line)

    Before taking this course, most of us probably have never touched the linux command line, so having to exclusively use them on OS maybe quite overwhelming. This guide covers the basic all the way to the advance stuff we can do in the command line to improve our flexibility and productivity. It even comes in [Bahasa Indonesia](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line/blob/master/README-id.md)! Credits to DAB - Dennis for sharing this one.

10. [My os212-dump Repository](https://github.com/david-alexander01/os212-dump)

    Have you ever spend an unhealthy amount of time trying to automate a 5 minute task? This repo is a collection of results of me doing that kind of stuff. That's a lot of "of"s.

    Interesting stuff about multithreading that we take for granted.
