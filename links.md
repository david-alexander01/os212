# Links

1. [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org)

    This course requires us to make a GitHub page with markdown. Me, having no experience with markdown found this page quite useful to familiarize myself with the syntaxes and best practices in markdowns.

2. [DILLINGER](https://dillinger.io/)
    
    Online markdown editor. The initial page serves as an example of markdown.

3. [RegExr](https://regexr.com/) and [i Hate Regex](https://ihateregex.io/)

    Do you hate writing regex? i Hate Regex has a bunch of regex for common problems, such as username, email, phone numbers, dates, and more! On the other hand, RegExr has a regex cheatsheet, lets you test out regex, and even explains the regex for you!
